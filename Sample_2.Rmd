```{r fitmodel}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R, data = airquality)

```

Here is a table of regression coefficients.

```{r showtable, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
xt <- xtable(summary(fit))
print(xt, type = "html")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
